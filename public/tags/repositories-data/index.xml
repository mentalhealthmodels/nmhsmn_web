      <title>Why share model code and data?</title>

      <description>There are many benefits to sharing model code and data in open access repositories. These benefits include helping to:
demonstrate study reproducibility; improve model transparency; elicit feedback; identify errors; increase impact; and reduce duplication of effort across the mental health modelling field. However, there are also practical barriers to sharing model code and data in an appropriate manner. These barriers can include:
concerns about data confidentiality and privacy; confusion about licensing; the need to identify appropriate storage and dissemination platforms; the time and effort required to prepare, document and curate content for public release; and lack of technical knowledge.</description>

      <description>To facilitate the sharing of model data by the Australian mental health modelling community, Acumen curates an open access data repository. The data repository is the Australian Mental Health Systems Models Dataverse.
If you have data from a mental health modelling project that you would like to share via this repository, check out this tutorial about how to do so.</description>
