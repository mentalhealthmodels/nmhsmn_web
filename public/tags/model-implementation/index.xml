      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Long, Katrina M and McDermott, F and Meadows, Graham N
Publication: Journal of the Operational Research Society
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2019.1650624
Method: A qualitative, longitudinal case study approach, grounded in Pragmatism, complexity theory, and the critical incident approach exploring implementation of simulation modelling in healthcare.
Message: Twenty-three critical incidents were identified, including changes in government policy and funding, organisational context, intervention activities, project management, and staffing. The analysis revealed a complex adaptive system, where the role of specific implementation factors changed over time, and through interaction with each other.</description>
