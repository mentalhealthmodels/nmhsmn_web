      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Atkinson, Jo-An and Page, Andrew and Skinner, Adam and Heffernan, Mark and Prodan, Ante and Hickie, Ian B.
Publication: Frontiers in Psychiatry.
Year: 2019
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00448
Method: A systems dynamics model was developed for Western Sydney Primary Health Network.
Message: Study findings suggest that i) not all reductions to psychiatric beds will result in increases in suicide deaths; ii) a threshold appears to exist beyond which cuts are likely to adversely impact suicides; and iii) the threshold can be significantly increased by strengthening community-based mental health services capacity.</description>
