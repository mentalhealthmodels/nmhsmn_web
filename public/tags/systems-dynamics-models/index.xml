      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Skinner, Adam and Occhipinti, Jo-An and Song, Yun Ju Christine and Hickie, Ian B.
Publication: BJPsych Open.
Year: 2021
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.989
Method: A systems dynamics model for 10 Primary Health Networks (PHNs) in New South Wales that serve regions that vary in terms of population size, geographic area, population density, levels of disadvantage and suicide rates.
Message: There is potential for substantial variation in projected reductions in suicide mortality if implementing a standardised state-based suicide prevention strategy versus a regionally driven approach.</description>
