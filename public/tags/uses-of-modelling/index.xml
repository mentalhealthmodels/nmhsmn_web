      <description>To introduce Acumen, members pooled their expertise to draft an article about the role of systems modelling in Australian mental health reform processes. The article provides an overview of current and previous mental health reform plans in Australia, identifies and describes different modelling approaches and the types of topics they are particularly well suited to addressing and discusses challenges and opportunities for planners and policymakers relating to the commissioning, development and use of model based tools.</description>

      <title>What is a mental health systems model?</title>
      <link>https://www.acumen-mh.org/blog/2020/05/14/whatisamhsm/</link>

      <description>A mental health systems model is a mathematical representation of the systems (economic, environmental, service, social and technical) that shape population mental health. These mathematical representations can be succinct (a brief mathematical formula) or highly detailed (complex networks of linked equations expressed as large bodies of computer code). When applied to relevant data, these models can produce insights to help planners and policy makers address a range of decision problems.</description>

      <title>Simulation modelling in mental health: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://www.acumen-mh.org/blog/2017/12/01/longk2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.acumen-mh.org/blog/2017/12/01/longk2018/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Long, Katrina M and Meadows, Graham N
Publication: Journal of Simulation
Year: 2018
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41273-017-0062-0
Method: A systematic review the use of simulation modelling in mental healthcare.
Message: There were widespread and innovative applications of simulation in the areas of medical decision making and epidemiology, with health system planning and optimisation relatively underrepresented. Markov modelling was the preferred method across area and illness. However, the literature is currently undermined by a lack of coherence and evidence of implementation, and there is an ongoing issue of accessing unpublished models from healthcare and government organisations.</description>
