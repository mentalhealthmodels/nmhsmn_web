      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Occhipinti, Jo-An and Skinner, Adam and Iorfino, Frank and Lawson, Kenny and Sturgess, Julie and Burgess, Warren and Davenport, Tracey and Hudson, Danica and Hickie, Ian.
Publication: BMC Medicine.
Year: 2021
DOI: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-01935-4
Method: Using a participatory approach, and informed by a range of national, state, and local datasets, a system dynamics model was developed, tested, and validated for a regional population catchment. The model incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behaviour.</description>

      <title>The science of complex systems is needed to ameliorate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health</title>
      <link>/blog/2020/11/25/atkinsonj2020/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2020/11/25/atkinsonj2020/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Atkinson, Jo-An and Song, Yun Ju Christine and Merikangas, Kathleen R and Skinner, Adam and Prodan, Ante and Iorfino, Frank and Freebairn, Louise and Rose, Danya and Ho, Nicholas and Crouse, Jacob and Zipunnikov, Vadim and Hickie, Ian.
Publication: Frontiers in Psychiatry.
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.606035
Method: Editorial.
Message: Applications of systems modeling in mental health research and practice have already demonstrated value in providing improved decision support capability and a better understanding of the different ways even “evidence-based” interventions can play out in diverse systems and settings.</description>

      <title>The National Mental Health Service Planning Framework: Where has it come from and what is its future?</title>
      <link>/blog/2020/11/02/whitefordh2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2020/11/02/whitefordh2020/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Whiteford, Harvey and Diminic, Sandra.
Publication: Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420963723
Method: Descriptive account of the background and application of the National Mental Health Service Planning Framework.
Message: Decentralised regional planning requires the application of a planning framework that sets targets for the same level of care for all Australians with equivalent needs, accounting for the specific characteristics and needs of local populations and the existing services and barriers to care.</description>

      <title>Systems modelling and simulation to inform strategic decision making for suicide prevention in rural New South Wales (Australia)</title>
      <link>/blog/2020/06/17/atkinsonj2020b/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2020/06/17/atkinsonj2020b/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Atkinson, Jo-An and Skinner, Adam and Hackney, Sue and Mason, Linda and Heffernan, Mark and Currier, Dianne and King, Kylie and Pirkis, Jane.
Publication: Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry.
Year 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420932639
Method: A system dynamics model for the rural and remote population catchment of Western New South Wales was developed. The model was based on defined pathways to mental health care and suicidal behaviour and reproduced historic trends in the incidence of attempted suicide (self-harm hospitalisations) and suicide deaths in the region.</description>

      <title>The impact of reducing psychiatric beds on suicide rates</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/07/02/atkinsonj2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2019/07/02/atkinsonj2021/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Atkinson, Jo-An and Page, Andrew and Skinner, Adam and Heffernan, Mark and Prodan, Ante and Hickie, Ian B.
Publication: Frontiers in Psychiatry.
Year: 2019
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00448
Method: A systems dynamics model was developed for Western Sydney Primary Health Network.
Message: Study findings suggest that i) not all reductions to psychiatric beds will result in increases in suicide deaths; ii) a threshold appears to exist beyond which cuts are likely to adversely impact suicides; and iii) the threshold can be significantly increased by strengthening community-based mental health services capacity.</description>

      <title>Resources for mental health: scarcity, inequity, and inefficiency</title>
      <link>/blog/2007/12/01/saxenas2007/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2007/12/01/saxenas2007/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Saxena, Shekhar and Thornicroft, Graham and Knapp, Martin and Whiteford, Harvey.
Publication: The Lancet.
Year: 2007
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2
Method: Narrative review and discussion of the international availability of resources for mental health, including policy and infrastructure within countries, mental health services, community resources, human resources, and funding.
Message: Government spending on mental health in most of the relevant countries is far lower than is needed, based on the proportionate burden of mental disorders and the availability of cost-effective and affordable interventions.</description>
