      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2020/05/07/walshe2020/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.

Publication: BMC Medical Research Methodology
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-00986-0
Method: Online survey of an international pool of policy-makers, health agency directors, and researchers with extensive and direct experience of using visual analytics tools for complex mental healthcare systems planning.
Message: Preliminary findings indicated that, despite a clear need to extract information from highly complex data, experts tend to utilise visualisations that are most familiar to them, widely understood, and not necessarily the most appropriate.</description>

      <title>An ecosystems approach to mental health services research</title>
      <link>/blog/2020/03/24/furstm2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2020 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2020/03/24/furstm2021/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Furst, Mary Anne and Bagheri, Nasser and Salvador-Carulla, Luis}
Publication: BJPsych International
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1192/bji.2020.24
Method: Descriptive summary of mental health ecosystems methods.
Message: Mental health ecosystems research is an emerging discipline which takes a whole-systems approach to mental healthcare, facilitating analysis of the complex environment and context of mental health systems, and translation of this knowledge into policy and practice. Evidence from the local context is needed in the analysis of complex interventions and of geographic variations in the outcomes of care.</description>

      <title>Factors affecting the implementation of simulation modelling in healthcare: A longitudinal case study evaluation</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/08/20/longk2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2019/08/20/longk2020/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Long, Katrina M and McDermott, F and Meadows, Graham N
Publication: Journal of the Operational Research Society
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2019.1650624
Method: A qualitative, longitudinal case study approach, grounded in Pragmatism, complexity theory, and the critical incident approach exploring implementation of simulation modelling in healthcare.
Message: Twenty-three critical incidents were identified, including changes in government policy and funding, organisational context, intervention activities, project management, and staffing. The analysis revealed a complex adaptive system, where the role of specific implementation factors changed over time, and through interaction with each other.</description>

      <title>Regional planning for meaningful person-centred care in mental health: context is the signal not the noise</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/12/01/rockd2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2017/12/01/rockd2020/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Rock, D and Cross, SP
Publication: Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences
Year: 2020
DOI: doi:10.1017/S2045796020000153
Method: Editorial.
Message: To ensure planned and provided care is most appropriate to more than merely the ‘average’ person requires a combination of (1) relevant, local and sophisticated data planning, collection and analysis systems, (2) more detailed person-centred service planning and delivery and (3) system accountability through co-design and transparent public reporting of health system performance in a manner that is understandable, relevant, and locally applicable.</description>

      <title>Simulation modelling in mental health: A systematic review</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/12/01/longk2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2017/12/01/longk2018/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Long, Katrina M and Meadows, Graham N
Publication: Journal of Simulation
Year: 2018
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41273-017-0062-0
Method: A systematic review the use of simulation modelling in mental healthcare.
Message: There were widespread and innovative applications of simulation in the areas of medical decision making and epidemiology, with health system planning and optimisation relatively underrepresented. Markov modelling was the preferred method across area and illness. However, the literature is currently undermined by a lack of coherence and evidence of implementation, and there is an ongoing issue of accessing unpublished models from healthcare and government organisations.</description>

      <title>Integrating clinicians, knowledge and data: expert-based cooperative analysis in healthcare decision support</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/09/30/gilbertk2010/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2010 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2010/09/30/gilbertk2010/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Gibert, Karina and García-Alonso, Carlos and Salvador-Carulla, Luis
Publication: Health research policy and systems
Year: 2010
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-4505-8-28
Method: Descriptive introduction of a new hybrid methodology Expert-based Cooperative Analysis (EbCA), which incorporates explicit prior expert knowledge in data analysis methods, and elicits implicit or tacit expert knowledge to improve decision support in healthcare systems. EbCA was compared to classical procedures using qualitative explicit prior knowledge in two case examples: 1) Bench-marking of small mental health areas based on technical efficiency estimated by EbCA-Data Envelopment Analysis (EbCA-DEA), and 2) Case-mix of schizophrenia based on functional dependency using Clustering Based on Rules (ClBR).</description>
