Authors: Rock, D and Cross, SP
Publication: Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences
Year: 2020
DOI: doi:10.1017/S2045796020000153
Method: Editorial.
Message: To ensure planned and provided care is most appropriate to more than merely the ‘average’ person requires a combination of (1) relevant, local and sophisticated data planning, collection and analysis systems, (2) more detailed person-centred service planning and delivery and (3) system accountability through co-design and transparent public reporting of health system performance in a manner that is understandable, relevant, and locally applicable.</description>

      <title>Simulation modelling in mental health: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://www.acumen-mh.org/blog/2017/12/01/longk2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 21:29:20 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.acumen-mh.org/blog/2017/12/01/longk2018/</guid>
      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Long, Katrina M and Meadows, Graham N
Publication: Journal of Simulation
Year: 2018
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41273-017-0062-0
Method: A systematic review the use of simulation modelling in mental healthcare.
Message: There were widespread and innovative applications of simulation in the areas of medical decision making and epidemiology, with health system planning and optimisation relatively underrepresented. Markov modelling was the preferred method across area and illness. However, the literature is currently undermined by a lack of coherence and evidence of implementation, and there is an ongoing issue of accessing unpublished models from healthcare and government organisations.</description>

Publication: Health research policy and systems
Year: 2010

Method: Descriptive introduction of a new hybrid methodology Expert-based Cooperative Analysis (EbCA), which incorporates explicit prior expert knowledge in data analysis methods, and elicits implicit or tacit expert knowledge to improve decision support in healthcare systems. EbCA was compared to classical procedures using qualitative explicit prior knowledge in two case examples: 1) Bench-marking of small mental health areas based on technical efficiency estimated by EbCA-Data Envelopment Analysis (EbCA-DEA), and 2) Case-mix of schizophrenia based on functional dependency using Clustering Based on Rules (ClBR).</description>
