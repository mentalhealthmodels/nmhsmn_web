      <description>To introduce Acumen, members pooled their expertise to draft an article about the role of systems modelling in Australian mental health reform processes. The article provides an overview of current and previous mental health reform plans in Australia, identifies and describes different modelling approaches and the types of topics they are particularly well suited to addressing and discusses challenges and opportunities for planners and policymakers relating to the commissioning, development and use of model based tools.</description>

      <title>Why share model code and data?</title>
      <link>https://www.acumen-mh.org/blog/2022/08/28/motivation/</link>

      <description>There are many benefits to sharing model code and data in open access repositories. These benefits include helping to:
demonstrate study reproducibility; improve model transparency; elicit feedback; identify errors; increase impact; and reduce duplication of effort across the mental health modelling field. However, there are also practical barriers to sharing model code and data in an appropriate manner. These barriers can include:
concerns about data confidentiality and privacy; confusion about licensing; the need to identify appropriate storage and dissemination platforms; the time and effort required to prepare, document and curate content for public release; and lack of technical knowledge.</description>

      <description>A mental health systems model is a mathematical representation of the systems (economic, environmental, service, social and technical) that shape population mental health. These mathematical representations can be succinct (a brief mathematical formula) or highly detailed (complex networks of linked equations expressed as large bodies of computer code). When applied to relevant data, these models can produce insights to help planners and policy makers address a range of decision problems.</description>

Method: Online survey of an international pool of policy-makers, health agency directors, and researchers with extensive and direct experience of using visual analytics tools for complex mental healthcare systems planning.
Message: Preliminary findings indicated that, despite a clear need to extract information from highly complex data, experts tend to utilise visualisations that are most familiar to them, widely understood, and not necessarily the most appropriate.</description>

Publication: BJPsych International
Year: 2020
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1192/bji.2020.24
Method: Descriptive summary of mental health ecosystems methods.
Message: Mental health ecosystems research is an emerging discipline which takes a whole-systems approach to mental healthcare, facilitating analysis of the complex environment and context of mental health systems, and translation of this knowledge into policy and practice. Evidence from the local context is needed in the analysis of complex interventions and of geographic variations in the outcomes of care.</description>

Method: A qualitative, longitudinal case study approach, grounded in Pragmatism, complexity theory, and the critical incident approach exploring implementation of simulation modelling in healthcare.
Message: Twenty-three critical incidents were identified, including changes in government policy and funding, organisational context, intervention activities, project management, and staffing. The analysis revealed a complex adaptive system, where the role of specific implementation factors changed over time, and through interaction with each other.</description>

Message: Study findings suggest that i) not all reductions to psychiatric beds will result in increases in suicide deaths; ii) a threshold appears to exist beyond which cuts are likely to adversely impact suicides; and iii) the threshold can be significantly increased by strengthening community-based mental health services capacity.</description>

      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Rock, D and Cross, SP
Publication: Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences
Year: 2020
DOI: doi:10.1017/S2045796020000153
Method: Editorial.
Message: To ensure planned and provided care is most appropriate to more than merely the ‘average’ person requires a combination of (1) relevant, local and sophisticated data planning, collection and analysis systems, (2) more detailed person-centred service planning and delivery and (3) system accountability through co-design and transparent public reporting of health system performance in a manner that is understandable, relevant, and locally applicable.</description>

      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Long, Katrina M and Meadows, Graham N
Publication: Journal of Simulation
Year: 2018
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41273-017-0062-0
Method: A systematic review the use of simulation modelling in mental healthcare.
Message: There were widespread and innovative applications of simulation in the areas of medical decision making and epidemiology, with health system planning and optimisation relatively underrepresented. Markov modelling was the preferred method across area and illness. However, the literature is currently undermined by a lack of coherence and evidence of implementation, and there is an ongoing issue of accessing unpublished models from healthcare and government organisations.</description>

      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes
Authors: Gibert, Karina and García-Alonso, Carlos and Salvador-Carulla, Luis
Publication: Health research policy and systems
Year: 2010
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-4505-8-28
Method: Descriptive introduction of a new hybrid methodology Expert-based Cooperative Analysis (EbCA), which incorporates explicit prior expert knowledge in data analysis methods, and elicits implicit or tacit expert knowledge to improve decision support in healthcare systems. EbCA was compared to classical procedures using qualitative explicit prior knowledge in two case examples: 1) Bench-marking of small mental health areas based on technical efficiency estimated by EbCA-Data Envelopment Analysis (EbCA-DEA), and 2) Case-mix of schizophrenia based on functional dependency using Clustering Based on Rules (ClBR).</description>

      <description>Peer reviewed: Yes.
Authors: Saxena, Shekhar and Thornicroft, Graham and Knapp, Martin and Whiteford, Harvey.
Publication: The Lancet.
Year: 2007
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61239-2
Method: Narrative review and discussion of the international availability of resources for mental health, including policy and infrastructure within countries, mental health services, community resources, human resources, and funding.
Message: Government spending on mental health in most of the relevant countries is far lower than is needed, based on the proportionate burden of mental disorders and the availability of cost-effective and affordable interventions.</description>
