abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common, lifelong inflammatory skin disease, the severity  of which can range from limited disease involving a small body surface area to  extensive skin involvement. It is associated with high levels of physical and  psychosocial disability and a range of comorbidities, including cardiovascular  disease, and it is currently incurable. OBJECTIVES: To (1) confirm which patients  with psoriasis are at highest risk of developing additional long-term conditions and  identify service use and costs to patient, (2) apply knowledge about risk of  comorbid disease to the development of targeted screening services to reduce risk of  further disease, (3) learn how patients with psoriasis cope with their condition and  about their views of service provision, (4) identify the barriers to provision of  best care for patients with psoriasis and (5) develop patient self-management  resources and staff training packages to improve the lives of people with psoriasis.  DESIGN: Mixed methods including two systematic reviews, one population cohort study,  one primary care screening study, one discrete choice study, four qualitative  studies and three mixed-methodology studies. SETTING: Primary care, secondary care  and online surveys. PARTICIPANTS: People with psoriasis and health-care  professionals who manage patients with psoriasis. RESULTS: Prevalence rates for  psoriasis vary by geographical location. Incidence in the UK was estimated to be  between 1.30{\%} and 2.60{\%}. Knowledge about the cost-effectiveness of therapies is  limited because high-quality clinical comparisons of interventions have not been  done or involve short-term follow-up. After adjusting for known cardiovascular risk  factors, psoriasis (including severe forms) was not found to be an independent risk  factor for major cardiovascular events; however, co-occurrence of inflammatory  arthritis was a risk factor. Traditional risk factors were high in patients with  psoriasis. Large numbers of patients with suboptimal management of known risk  factors were found by screening patients in primary care. Risk information was  seldom discussed with patients as part of screening consultations, meaning that a  traditional screening approach may not be effective in reducing comorbidities  associated with psoriasis. Gaps in training of health-care practitioners to manage  psoriasis effectively were identified, including knowledge about risk factors for  comorbidities and methods of facilitating behavioural change. Theory-based,  high-design-quality patient materials broadened patient understanding of psoriasis  and self-management. A 1-day training course based on motivational interviewing  principles was effective in increasing practitioner knowledge and changing  consultation styles. The primary economic analysis indicated a high level of  uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis indicated some situations when the interventions  may be cost-effective. The interventions need to be assessed for long-term  (cost-)effectiveness. LIMITATIONS: The duration of patient follow-up in the study of  cardiovascular disease was relatively short; as a result, future studies with longer  follow-up are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of the nature of the psoriasis  and its impact, knowledge of best practice and guideline use are all limited in  those most likely to provide care for the majority of patients. Patients and  practitioners are likely to benefit from the provision of appropriate support and/or  training that broadens understanding of psoriasis as a complex condition and  incorporates support for appropriate health behaviour change. Both interventions  were feasible and acceptable to patients and practitioners. Cost-effectiveness  remains to be explored. FUTURE WORK: Patient support materials have been created for  patients and NHS providers. A 1-day training programme with training materials for  dermatologists, specialist nurses and primary care practitioners has been designed.  Spin-off research projects include a national study of responses to psoriasis  therapy and a global study of the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis. A new  clinical service is being developed locally based on the key findings of the  Identification and Management of Psoriasis Associated ComorbidiTy (IMPACT)  programme. FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health  Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research programme and will be  published in full in Programme Grants for Applied Research; Vol. 10, No. 3.
