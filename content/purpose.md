Acumen aims to improve population mental health through ensuring mental health system planners have access to the highest quality decision aids and to provide policymakers with the tools to better addres the social determinants of mental ill-health.

Acumen will do this by:

- Creating a national alliance to [identify opportunities for collaboration](/blog/resources/planner-resources/) and [data sharing](/blog/resources/modeller-resources/open-code-and-data/) in mental health systems modelling;

- Providing a central national reference point for [expert advice](/members/) and [best practice in evidence-based modelling](/blog/resources/modeller-resources/) for mental health policy and services;

- Providing scientific peer review and recommendations to relevant parties that could be provided as [tools to assist regional mental health planning](/blog/our-work/decision-aids/); and

- Supporting implementation of [evidence-based mental health planning](/categories/publications-mental-health-policy/) on-the-ground.
