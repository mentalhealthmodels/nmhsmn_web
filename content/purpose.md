The National Mental Health Systems Modelling Network aims to improve population mental health through ensuring mental health system planners have access to the highest quality decision aids and to provide policymakers with the tools to better addres the social determinants of mental ill-health.

The National Mental Health Systems Modelling Network will do this by:

- Creating a national network to identify opportunities for collaboration and data sharing in mental health service modelling.

- Providing a central national reference point for expert advice and best practice in evidence-based modelling for policy and services.

- Providing scientific peer review and recommendations to relevant parties that could be provided as tools to assist regional mental health planning.

- Supporting implementation of evidence-based mental health planning on-the-ground.
