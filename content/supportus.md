Currently, the work of Acumen is principally advanced through the vouluntary contribution of time and effort from Acumen members. We believe that to further develop the mental health modelling field and to improve access for mental health planners to the highest quality decision support tools will require ongoing centralised resourcing of training, data infrastructure and quality-assurance tools. We will therefore welcome approaches from potential philanthropic funders to explore how we can partner to improve mental health outcomes in Australia (see how to [contact us](../contact)).
