To facilitate the sharing of model code and data by the Australian mental health modelling community, our network curates two open access repositories.

- For code, we maintain the [Australian Mental Health Systems Models Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/openmind/)

- For data, we maintain the [Australian Mental Health Systems Models Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/openmind)

If you have code or data from a mental health modelling project that you would like to share via these repositories, check out [this tutorial](../../../../2022/08/01/managing_open_data/) about how to do so.
