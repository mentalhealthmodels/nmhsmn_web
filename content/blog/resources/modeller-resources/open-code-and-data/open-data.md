title: Australian Mental Health Systems Models Dataverse

To facilitate the sharing of model data by the Australian mental health modelling community, our network curates an open access data repository. The data repository is the [Australian Mental Health Systems Models Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/openmind).

If you have data from a mental health modelling project that you would like to share via this repository, check out [this tutorial](../../../../2022/08/01/managing_open_data/) about how to do so.
