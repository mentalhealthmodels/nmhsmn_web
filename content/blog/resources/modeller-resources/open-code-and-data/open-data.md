To facilitate the sharing of model data by the Australian mental health modelling community, our network curates an open access data repository. The data repository is the [Australian Mental Health Systems Models Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/openmind).

If you have data from a mental health modelling project that you would like to share via this repository, check out [this tutorial](../../../../2022/08/01/managing_open_data/) about how to do so.
