title: Australian Mental Health Systems Models Zenodo Community
---

To facilitate the sharing of model code by the Australian mental health modelling community, our network curates an open access code repository. The code repository is the [Australian Mental Health Systems Models Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/openmind/).

Linked to this repository is the network's [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/mentalhealthmodels). Currently our GitHub organisation is just used to host the source code for this website, but over time we aim to use it to share brief code snippets that may not be appropriate for archiving in our Zenodo repository.
