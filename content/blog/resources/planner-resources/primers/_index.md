One of the main roles of the network is to provide mental health planners and policymakers with increased knowledge and confidence about how to commission, co-develop, apply and refine model based decision aids. One of the ways we seek to fulfill this role is to provide "bite-sized" written primers that explain specific systems modelling topics and which collectively aim to provide practical guidance about how to develop frutiful collaborations with mental health modellers.
