Our members develop models to i) answer research questions about mental health policy and system design; and/or ii) to provide the basis for decision aids that can be used by mental health planners and policy makers to explore multiple topics. We also contribute to the development of the mental health modelling field by publishing on issues relating to the design, conduct and application of modelling studies.
