**Method**: Descriptive overview of the role of modelling in mental health policy and system design, explanation of concepts useful for understanding mental health modelling and overview of how ta new network of modellers and planners hopes to support the development of better and more useful mental health systems models. 

**Message**: Modelling can help decision-makers understand likely future changes in mental health service demand and more intelligently choose appropriate responses. It can also support greater scrutiny, accountability and transparency of these processes. Australia has an emerging national capacity for system modelling in mental health which can enhance the next phase of mental health reform.
