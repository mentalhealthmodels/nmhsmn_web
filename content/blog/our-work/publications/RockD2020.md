title: "Regional planning for meaningful person-centred care in mental health: context is the signal not the noise"

**Peer reviewed**: Yes.

**Authors**: Rock, D and Cross, SP

**Publication**: Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences

**Year**: 2020 

**DOI**: doi:10.1017/S2045796020000153

**Method**: Editorial.

**Message**:  To ensure planned and provided care is most appropriate to more than merely the ‘average’ person requires a combination of (1) relevant, local and sophisticated data planning, collection and analysis systems, (2) more detailed person-centred service planning and delivery and (3) system accountability through co-design and transparent public reporting of health system performance in a manner that is understandable, relevant, and locally applicable. Achieving genuine person-centred care requires greater appreciation of healthcare as a complex adaptive (eco)system, where context is everything, and then utilising planning, analysis and management methodologies that reflect this reality.
