title: "Factors affecting the implementation of simulation modelling in healthcare: A longitudinal case study evaluation"
---

**Peer reviewed**: Yes

**Authors**: Long, Katrina M and McDermott, F and Meadows, Graham N

**Publication**: Journal of the Operational Research Society

**Year**: 2020

**DOI**: https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2019.1650624

**Method**: A qualitative, longitudinal case study approach, grounded in Pragmatism, complexity theory, and the critical incident approach exploring implementation of simulation modelling in healthcare.

**Message**: Twenty-three critical incidents were identified, including changes in government policy and funding, organisational context, intervention activities, project management, and staffing. The analysis revealed a complex adaptive system, where the role of specific implementation factors changed over time, and through interaction with each other. Constant throughout was the agency displayed by participants in pursing their individual strategic goals. A flexible definition of implementation success that allows for emergent project outcomes is recommended.
