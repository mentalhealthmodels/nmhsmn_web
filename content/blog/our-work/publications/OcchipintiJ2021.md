**Method**: Using a participatory approach, and informed by a range of national, state, and local datasets, a system dynamics model was developed, tested, and validated for a regional population catchment. The model incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and suicidal behaviour. Intervention scenarios were investigated to forecast their impact on suicidal behaviour over a 20-year period. 

**Message**: Results indicate that targeted investments in addressing the social determinants and in mental health services provides the best opportunity to reduce suicidal behaviour and suicide. Systems modelling and simulation offers a robust approach to leveraging best available research, data, and expert knowledge in a way that helps decision makers respond to the unique characteristics and drivers of suicidal behaviour in their catchments and more effectively focus limited health resources.
