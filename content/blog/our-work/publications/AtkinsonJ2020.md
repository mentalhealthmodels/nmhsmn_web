**Message**: Applications of systems modeling in mental health research and practice have already demonstrated value in providing improved decision support capability and a better understanding of the different ways even “evidence-based” interventions can play out in diverse systems and settings. Transparent, and interactive model interfaces allow regional or national decision makers and stakeholders to run simulations and test alternative scenarios and assumptions, driving more informed debate abouts trade-offs and facilitating consensus building for collaborative action. These processes are essential to the mobilization of appropriate levels of financial, infrastructure and workforce resourcing for rapid system responses to be mounted effectively.
