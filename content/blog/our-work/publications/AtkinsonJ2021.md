title: "The impact of reducing psychiatric beds on suicide rates"
---

**Peer reviewed**: Yes.

**Authors**: Atkinson, Jo-An and Page, Andrew and Skinner, Adam and Heffernan, Mark and Prodan, Ante and Hickie, Ian B.

**Publication**: Frontiers in Psychiatry.

**Year**: 2019

**DOI**: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00448

**Method**: A systems dynamics model was developed for Western Sydney Primary Health Network.

**Message**: Study findings suggest that i) not all reductions to psychiatric beds will result in increases in suicide deaths; ii) a threshold appears to exist beyond which cuts are likely to adversely impact suicides; and iii) the threshold can be significantly increased by strengthening community-based mental health services capacity.
