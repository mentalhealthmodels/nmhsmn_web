---

**Peer reviewed**: Yes.

**Authors**: Zabell, Thea Simone and Long, Katrina M and Scott, Debbie and Hope, Judith and McLoughlin, Ian and Enticott, Joanne.

**Publication**: Frontiers in Health Services.

**Year**: 2021

**DOI**: https://doi.org/10.3389/frhs.2021.644831

**Method**: A systematic review on simulation modelling studies with a health outcome which engaged stakeholders in model design.

**Message**: There is a large gap in the current literature of formal evaluation of simulation modelling stakeholder engagement, and a lack of consensus about the processes required for effective simulation modelling stakeholder engagement. The adoption and clear reporting of structured engagement and process evaluation methodologies/frameworks are required to advance the field and produce evidence of impact.
