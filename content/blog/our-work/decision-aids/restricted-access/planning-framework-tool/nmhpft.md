title: National Mental Health Service Planning Framework - Planning Support Tool
---

**Purpose:** The National Mental Health Service Planning Framework (NMHSPF) is a model designed to help plan, coordinate and resource mental health services to meet population demands. The NMHSPF-Planning Support Tool (NMHSPF-PST) is an interactive data visualisation tool that allows users to estimate need and expected demand for mental health care and the level and mix of mental health services required for a given population.

**Who can access it?** Mental health planners working in licensed organisations (typically State and Territory Government departments and Primary Health Networks) can apply to be trained on using NMHSPF-PST. Access to NMHSPF-PST is provided on completion of the training.

**Documentation / training:** More information about NMHSPF-PST and its underlying model at: https://www.aihw.gov.au/nmhspf
